# db-mgmt-project
Personal project for database management course.
The goal is to create a database of upcoming events near Provo, UT.
The code scrapes utah.com and byu.edu for events, cleans the data, and inputs the records into a mysql database. The robots.txt files from each site were checked and neither disallowed the scraping.
The resulting database will be connected to an appsheet app to allow manual input of other events not on the sites.
